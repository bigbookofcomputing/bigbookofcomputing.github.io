## 📖 About

The **Big Book of Computing** is a comprehensive, open-source educational series covering the entire computational domain—from numerical foundations through quantum frontiers. Unlike traditional textbooks that become outdated, this is a **living knowledge graph** actively maintained and expanded by a multi-agent AI system.

This repository hosts the landing page and central hub for the four-volume series:

- 🔢 **[Volume I: Foundation of Computational Science](https://bigbookofcomputing.github.io/foundation/)** — Numerical methods and foundations
- 🧬 **[Volume II: Simulating Complex Systems](https://bigbookofcomputing.github.io/simulation/)** — Monte Carlo, dynamics, and emergence
- 🤖 **[Volume III: Data, Optimization & Machine Learning](https://bigbookofcomputing.github.io/optimization/)** — From data to intelligence
- ⚛️ **[Volume IV: Quantum Computing & Information](https://bigbookofcomputing.github.io/quantum/)** — The quantum paradigm

## 🌟 What Makes This Unique?

### A Living Knowledge Graph

This isn't a static textbook—it's a **dynamic knowledge graph** where:

- **Multi-Agent AI System** — Coordinated agents build, expand, and maintain content
- **Real-Time Research Integration** — Reference agents scan arXiv, PubMed, and DOI databases
- **Automatic Quality Control** — Consistency agents ensure notation and terminology coherence
- **Cross-Volume Connections** — Knowledge graph agents link concepts across all volumes
- **Continuous Updates** — Content evolves with the field, never becoming outdated

### Comprehensive Computational Coverage

The series provides a complete computational toolkit:

```
Volume I: Foundations
    ↓ (provides numerical methods)
Volume II: Simulation
    ↓ (generates data and models)
Volume III: Optimization & ML
    ↓ (extracts patterns and learns)
Volume IV: Quantum Computing
    ↓ (enables quantum advantage)
```

Each volume builds on previous ones while remaining accessible independently.
